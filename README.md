# Coding-Quiz

## Description
This repository consists of the code used to create my multiple choice quiz. The quiz is modeled and inspired by classic, early 2000's spam emails/pop-ups. Almost completely composed of javascript, this project showcases my ability to create and style pages with minimal use of html and css. 

### Technologies
Project is created with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Functionality
The quiz and timer start as soon the user presses on the "Click here to claim your prize" button on the opening page. From there, it asks a series of multiple choice questions designed to challenge the users' critical thinking. If the user answers a question correctly, a prompt will display reading "Correct!", and they will be directed to the next question. If the user answers incorrectly, a prompt reading "Wrong!" will appear, the correct answer will be displayed, and 10 seconds will be deducted from their remaining time. If the timer reaches "0" before the quiz is completed, the user will be directed to the ending page where their final score will be displayed, and an input box to enter their initials will appear. Once the user enters their initials, their name + score will be saved and added to the "Highscores" page. This page can be accessed by clicking "View Highscores" and will list all previously submitted scores in descending order.
